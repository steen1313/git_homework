1. My first takeaways from my first few sessions at Turing, is that this is hard and fast paced. I have to study to keep up with the rest of the group.
2. Time management is important as heck. I have to keep a pretty rigid schedule to get things done on time.

2 strategies
1. My first strategy to to add for the rest of mod 0 is to review every lesson before hand.
2. My second strategy is to take better notes, as they may differ from the lesson a little bit.

Shoutouts!
I have so many shoutouts. First to my partner Chaz, who is also in Mod 0, who has been my rock in calming me down. Second to my sister Janika who is also a student here at Turing for keeping my head straight.
